*** React Notes

JSX (javascript xml) => used to include html code in js files

  // const paragraph = document.createElement('p');
  // paragraph.textContent = 'This is a demo paragraph';
  // document.getElementById('root').append(paragraph);

Above is an imperative approach of adding a paragraph to the html page. 
Using react is a declarative approach.



*** Building a custom component

App => main/root component that is in the starting file of index.js

everything else are child components of App => react tree with App being the parent
Other components will be used as regular html elements in the index file.

A component in React => just a plain JS function (special case which returns cusotm Jsx code)

* should only have one root element per JSX code snippet/return statement => workaround is to wrap everything in a single div
